for apk download. click on download

installation steps: 
1) it will say google drive cant scan this file for viruses/file might be harmful click on download anyway.
2) open that apk from your downloaded location click on package installer --> install
3) a google play protect popup will appear "unsafe app blocked" click on more details --> install anyway --> open

notes:
1) it will show "file might be harmful" because we have installed the app from an unknown source and not from any authorized or reliable website.
2) google play protect popup is appearing due to i have not yet uploaded it on playstore as its asking me for payment so i have directly shared the 
app with the help of hosting websites.
3) its 100% safe no need to worry you can also have a antivirus scan on the same after installation.
4) to play the game you need to have an internet connection because it is being hosted online.
